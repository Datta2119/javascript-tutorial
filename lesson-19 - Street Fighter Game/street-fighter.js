/*
ðŸŒŸ APP: Fighting Game

Create an updateGame() function that will update the DOM with the state of the game ðŸ‘‡
========================================

- updateGame()

These are the 2 classes you must create and their methods ðŸ‘‡
========================================

class Player {
  - strike()
  - heal()
}

class Game {
  - play()
  - checkIsOver()
  - declareWinner()
  - reset()
}

These functions are hard coded in the HTML. So, you can't change their names.

These are all the DIV ID's you're gonna need access to ðŸ‘‡
========================================================
#1 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'play' = Button to run simulation
#2 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'result' = Div that holds the winner of the match
#3 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'p1Name' = Div that holds player 1's Name
#4 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'p2Name' = Div that holds player 2's Name
#5 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'p1Health' = Div that holds player 1's health
#6 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'p2Health' = Div that holds player 2's health
